# Contributing Guidelines

## Branch Naming

- Feature branches: `feature/<issue-description>`
- Fix branches: `fix/<issue-description>`

## Commit Style

We follow Angular commit style:
- Prefix: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `test`, `refactor`
- Use imperative form: "adds feature" not "added feature"
- Example: `feat: adds zones CRUD endpoints`

## Pull Request Process

1. Create a feature branch from `master`
2. Make your changes
3. Create a PR to `master`
4. Request review from team members
5. Address review comments
6. Merge after approval

## Issues

- All issues must be assigned to a team member
- Link PRs to related issues
- Use GitHub labels for categorization
